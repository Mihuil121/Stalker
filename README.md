## Project Description

This project is a website inspired by the game **Stalker 2**. I created it to try to replicate the atmosphere and design of my favorite project in the gaming industry. Throughout the development process, I aimed to enhance my skills in **TypeScript** and **React**, as well as to learn how to work with **Zustand** for state management in the application.

## Technologies

- **TypeScript**: A programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript.
- **React**: A library for building user interfaces.
- **Swiper**: A library for creating sliders and carousels.
- **Zustand**: A simple and efficient state management library for React applications.


## Usage

Once the project is running, you will be able to see an interface inspired by Stalker 2. Explore different sections of the website and enjoy the game's atmosphere.
